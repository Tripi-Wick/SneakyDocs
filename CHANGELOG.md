# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-07
### Added
- After collapsing, the editor keeps the line you were on centered in view, so
  the file no longer appears to jump as the hidden content shifts upward.
### Fixed
- The first **Toggle Collapse Docs** after opening a file now collapses every
  doc block. VS Code builds its folding model asynchronously, so the initial
  fold previously ran before the model existed and left some or all blocks
  expanded; only a second toggle worked. The folding provider now signals when
  VS Code has queried it, and folding waits for that signal instead of guessing.
  If the model never becomes ready, the toggle now does nothing rather than
  fold the wrong region.
- Toggling no longer folds into the wrong file if you switch tabs while the
  folding model is still being prepared.
- The toggle now only acts on regular files on disk, matching where the folding
  providers are registered; diff and preview editors no longer risk folding the
  wrong region.
- Fold tracking now follows the file as you edit, so toggling still collapses
  and expands correctly after changes above a collapsed block.
- Reopening a previously collapsed file no longer mis-toggles: remembered fold
  state is dropped when a document closes.

- Removed unnecessary functionalities:
  - Collapse/uncollapse context menu buttons. <- With toggle functionlity those are not needed.
  - Generating JsDocs <- Not really needed, thousands of extensions will do it way better.
